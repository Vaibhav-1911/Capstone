## Detecting Emergency Situations Using Audio Data

### Dataset
#### Sources: The audio data samples for this project have been collected from online sources such as “Zapslat.com”, “Pixabay.com,” and “Directory. Audio”. 
#### Description: The dataset consists of 220 total samples equally divided between two classes namely, “Emergency Sounds” and “General Sounds”.
#### In addition we have also collected 14 total audio samples equally divided between the two classes for testing the model performance. These have been separately stored unseen by the model to prevent overfitting.

### Business Problem
#### - Training a neural network model to identify instances of emergency using live audio.
##### - We aim to develop a system that can accurately detect emergency situations using audio data, with the goal of contributing to more effective early warning systems and improving emergency response times.
